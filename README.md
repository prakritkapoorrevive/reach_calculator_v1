# Reach Calculator Streamlit App

This app uses the exact `calculate_reach` function and helpers from the original notebook.
Place `census_data_cleaned.csv`, `zip_data_trimmed.csv`, and `deals_data_cleaned.csv` in the same folder before running.

Run locally:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
